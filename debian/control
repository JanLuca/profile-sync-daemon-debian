Description: Symlinks and syncs browser profile dirs into RAM
 Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed 
 to manage your browser's profile in tmpfs and to periodically
 sync it back to your physical disc (HDD/SSD).
 . 
 This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative
 use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization between
 the two. One of the major design goals of psd is a completely
 transparent user experience.
